        The Sobering facility provides a safe environment designed to meet the needs of intoxicated individuals for up
        to 23 hours allowing the individual to become sober and interrupt cycles of use while determining individual
        needs and desires for next steps with the goal of becoming sober and working with staff to identify their needs
        and desire to enter treatment. If the client wishes to enter treatment, staff will coordinate for screening through
        ACCESS for identification of the next level of care. The Population served are men and women who are at
        least 18 years of age presenting with a substance use disorder diagnosis. Walk Ins, hospital, law enforcement

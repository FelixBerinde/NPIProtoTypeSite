        Clients involved with the criminal justice system are often referred to counseling in an attempt to resolve the 
        personal concerns that lead to their involvement in criminal activities. Many times this includes substance use 
        disorders, mental health issues, and often co-occurring disorders. Communication between the primary therapist 
        and the referring agency/officer is key to effective client participation. For many clients, successful completion of treatment 
        is paramount to being released from supervision of the criminal justice system. Case management services are often necessary with 
        this population to coordinate the variety of services needed.

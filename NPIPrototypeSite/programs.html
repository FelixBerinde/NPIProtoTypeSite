    <h2 class="center-text">Day Treatment and Intensive Outpatient</h2>
    <p>Day Treatment and IOP services each provide a measured level of structure which is more than
traditional outpatient, yet far less restrictive than residential.

Both provide combinations of group, didactic and individual therapy in the context of a daily milieu treatment setting while utilizing the home environment as a support to the recovery plan. The scope, frequency, and duration of Day Treatment and IOP services are dependent upon a variety of factors, including insurance requirements and client need. Persons admitted to this level of care have a primary
diagnosis of chemical dependency. Clients may be referred to this level of care as part of a continuing care plan after leaving residential treatment. Clients may also be referred to this level of care when it is determined that outpatient counseling services are not intense enough to provide the support or structure necessary for the client. For either of these situations, the goal of this level of care is to provide the person served the necessary tools to develop a healthy, recovery oriented lifestyle. A long-term recovery plan is established for all clients, and may include additional counseling following completion of the Day Treatment/IOP episode. Appropriate psychiatric services referrals are made as necessary.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: strong">A 24 hour, seven day per week, controlled, supervised environment in which persons served reside and receive intensive treatment from specially trained counseling staff.</p>
    <p>The goal of this program is to interrupt the client’s harmful involvement with alcohol or other drugs, and begin to establish a recovery lifestyle. Residential treatment consists of designated medical and clinical staff members that provide a planned regime of professionally directed assessment, treatment, and rehabilitation services.  This service functions under a set of policies and procedures and is provided within a permanent facility that is licensed for residential care. Treatment services include a range of therapeutic interventions, modalities, and approaches within a single therapeutic environment. Persons admitted to this level of care have a primary diagnosis of chemical dependency. Because the client leaves familiar surroundings where negative behavior patterns are established and reinforced, the likelihood of learning more productive behaviors is enhanced in residential treatment. Residential services are designed to interrupt harmful involvement with alcohol or other drugs, and to help the person develop a plan to achieve permanent changes in his or her life. In addition, the services provide appropriate levels of medical monitoring for those clients experiencing the need for sub-acute detoxification.  Appropriate psychiatric services referrals are made as necessary.</p>

These clients do not require hospitalization to manage their symptoms, but do require structured 24-hour supervision and appropriate medical/clinical intervention. Medications, as approved by the Clients physician of record, may be used, and, as with all medications, that are individually prescribed. These clients are mainstreamed into standard residential therapy activities when deemed appropriate.
